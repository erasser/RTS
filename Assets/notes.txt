Prevent unit to slide from slope when should stand still. - Try to use rigid body position constraint? It could be turned off on collision.

Continue to move forward a bit, if unit stops on another unit, so it stands on the ground at the end. 

• Move unit, if it's standing on another unit \m/.

• If a target is close & back to the unit, maybe the unit could just go back a little - I decided not to implement this.

• When initiating unit movement, rotate first and then move.
