Test if raycast against ground & hostile units in UpdateShootLaser() works (against hostile units it's tested)

reset cockpit rotation & don't allow to turn it downside

click on minimap

unit info billboard

unit cam view

add ufo unit

------------------------------

Solve hotfix nit UpdateCockpitAndCannonRotation()

Create weapon classes

Prevent unit to slide from slope when should stand still. - Try to use rigid body position constraint? It could be turned off on collision.
    Maybe it's not a problem - try to stop object on a steep slope. - Ne, je to špatný, klouže to furt dolů.

Continue to move forward a bit, if unit stops on another unit, so it stands on the ground at the end.

If another unit is close when initiating movement, unit can't turn. Try to solve by pushing the another unit off a bit - nope.

Manage the state, when a unit ends upside down

Laser should not be fired if target is under shooter unit's view horizon.

Automate map generation in:
    - DrawUnitOnMap() - map dimensions
    - GenerateMap() - camera position

It would be cool to have minimap as Image element -  now it's button due to click event (just remove Button component & add an event trigger).

TEST PERFORMANCE
════════════════
- InvokeRepeating vs. Coroutines vs. custom solution (time tracking) - https://forum.unity.com/threads/invokerepeating-vs-coroutines-performance.497208
- Raycast
- Vector3.magnitude vs. my SquareRoot.cs from Vector3.sqrMagnitude

• Turn laser on after it's aimed by canon
• If a new target if too close, unit doesn't move.
• Move unit, if it's standing on another unit \m/.
• If a target is close & back to the unit, maybe the unit could just go back a little - I decided not to implement this.
• When initiating unit movement, rotate first and then move.
