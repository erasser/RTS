Když jsem 2 jednotky targetil navzájem, chvíli to fungovalo, pak to spadlo
Aby nemohla jednotka targetit sama sebe
Zkusit rozložit regular pathfinding kalkulace v čase, dělat v dávkách pro x jednotek najednou

► Nejsou wheel collider trochu overkill? Přicházím také o možnost nastavit tření

► Bars Render Texture material is Particles/Standard Unlit :-O

Fix bars position at the edges of screen

Try to add & raycast simpler collider on units (and maybe on the ground?)

380: return cockpit to initial rotation

If heading to selected hostile target, don't stop when near to another hostile unit.

What should happen if targeted unit is destroyed meanwhile by other unit? Maybe the unit should head to the location of destroyed unit.

When unit's shoot at target is destroyed or leaves, unit should find it's new target.
    Also check a situation, when hostile unit is targeted and leaves.

If heading to selected hostile target, don't stop when near to another hostile unit.

What should happen if targeted unit is destroyed meanwhile by other unit? Maybe the unit should head to the location of destroyed unit.

Test if raycast against ground & hostile units in UpdateShootLaser() works (against hostile units it's tested)

reset cockpit rotation & don't allow to turn it downside

click on minimap

add ufo unit

------------------------------

Solve hotfix nit UpdateCockpitAndCannonRotation()

Create weapon classes

Prevent unit to slide from slope when should stand still. - Try to use rigid body position constraint? It could be turned off on collision.
    Maybe it's not a problem - try to stop object on a steep slope. - Ne, je to špatný, klouže to furt dolů.

Continue to move forward a bit, if unit stops on another unit, so it stands on the ground at the end.

If another unit is close when initiating movement, unit can't turn. Try to solve by pushing the another unit off a bit - nope.

Manage the state, when a unit ends upside down

Laser should not be fired if target is under shooter unit's view horizon.

Automate map generation in:
    - DrawUnitOnMap() - map dimensions
    - GenerateMap() - camera position

It would be cool to have minimap as Image element -  now it's button due to click event (just remove Button component & add an event trigger).


• Turn laser on after it's aimed by canon
• If a new target if too close, unit doesn't move.
• Move unit, if it's standing on another unit \m/.
• If a target is close & back to the unit, maybe the unit could just go back a little - I decided not to implement this.
• When initiating unit movement, rotate first and then move.
• Laser is not visible on short distance (but it's active)
• Set UnitInfoRenderTextureOverlay & RenderTexture sizes dynamically
