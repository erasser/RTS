• Try to sync FPS with FixedUpdate
• There exists OnDemandRendering
• LOD models (LOD Group component)
• Mobile shader materials


TEST PERFORMANCE
════════════════
- InvokeRepeating vs. Coroutines vs. custom solution (time tracking) - https://forum.unity.com/threads/invokerepeating-vs-coroutines-performance.497208
- Raycast
- Vector3.magnitude vs. my SquareRoot.cs from Vector3.sqrMagnitude


TESTS ON MOBILE
===============
• It seems that if the game runs longer, FPS got higher after build
Lowest settings (2 units, no lasers, no info bars)          50
Lowest settings (2 units, no lasers)                        37  => * info bars costs 10+ FPS
Lowest settings + only full textured ground                 21  => heavy FPS impact of PB texture (but should be quartered by settings now)
Lowest settings + 40 units (including lasers, no info bars) 27  => * info bars don't cost FPS
Lowest settings + 40 units (including lasers)               27  => Each unit cost FPS
